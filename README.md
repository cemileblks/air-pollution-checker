<h1>Air Pollution Checker</h1>

## Overview

This project is an air pollution website developed as part of a front-end bootcamp. The website allows users to input a location and retrieve air quality information for that specific city or country. This information is particularly useful for individuals with respiratory issues, helping them make informed decisions about their outdoor activities and health management.

## Features

Location Search: Users can input a location (city or country) to retrieve air quality information.

Air Quality Data: The website fetches data from APIs to display various air quality metrics such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3).

Historical Data: Users can view historical air quality data for a specific location to understand trends over time.

User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to interact with the website and access the information they need.

Responsive Design: The website is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used

React: The front-end of the website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

APIs: The website integrates with various APIs to fetch air quality data, including the OpenWeatherMap API and other relevant air quality monitoring APIs.

CSS Framework: A CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Material-UI) may be used for styling and layout to achieve a polished and professional look.

Git: Version control is managed using Git, allowing for collaborative development and tracking of changes.
